# TORC: Tools for Optimization, Robotics, and Control
This repository is for a currently in-development set of tools for optimization based control of robotic systems.
A full description of the capabilities and documentation of the library will be available soon.

The code is written in C++ with real-time applications in mind. Ultimately, the code will be able to help users 
setup reduced and full order models for robots, and create, manage, and approximate constraints and costs.
